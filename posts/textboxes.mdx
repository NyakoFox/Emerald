Textboxes in video games come in all shapes and sizes. Well, most of the time, they're rectangles, and they take up roughly 1/3rd of the screen. Bad start.

But the important part isn't their fancy designs or slick animations -- it's their text. Whether it appears all at once, or letter by letter, it most likely has some sort of *formatting*.

## The Na√Øve Approach

I often see tutorials make a system where text gets parsed every draw. This is **very expensive**, especially during render time, where frames matter.

It goes something like this:

- We have some sort of default state, like the text being white, the font size, etc.
- We loop through each character to draw, according to the state
- If we encounter a modifier, change the state instead
- Keep drawing each character (unless they're part of a modifier of course)

This comes with a few flaws:

1. **Code duplication** -- You may have to copy you modifier handling to both be in the update/step code *and* the draw/render code to make letter-by-letter text skip past modifiers,
2. **Slow code** -- String manipulation is costly, and you don't want to be doing that very often, especially not a hundred times per render frame.
3. **Spaghetti code** -- Handling modifiers and drawing characters both in the render function might lead to some ugly code.

So... the current examples out there aren't that great. What should we do instead?

## The Node System

No, not JavaScript.

The node system is a way to represent text as a list of nodes, where each node is a character or a modifier. This way, we can easily loop through each node and draw them accordingly.

An example of a modifier node's structure is as follows:

```lua {2} /#ff00ff/#ff00ff
local node = {
    type = "modifier",
    command = "color",
    arguments = "#ff00ff"
}
```

This node would change the color of the following text to a magenta. Additionally, a text node would look like this:

```lua {2}
local node = {
    type = "character",
    character = "H"
}
```

This node would draw the character "H" in the current state. If this node follows the previous modifier node, it would be drawn in magenta.

### Constructing the Nodes

Node construction can be as simple as you want it to be. A regex, a simple loop through the string, or even a custom parser. In [Kristal's text system](https://github.com/KristalTeam/Kristal/blob/main/src/engine/objects/text.lua#L204), we chose to loop through the string.

Regex is most likely the most efficient way to do this, but not everyone knows regex, and I like to keep things simple anyway.

### Processing the Nodes

Once you have your nodes, you can loop through them and draw them accordingly. If your node is a character, draw it. If it's a modifier, change the state accordingly. Simple, right?

### Kristal's Text System

Talking about [Kristal](https://kristal.cc/) for a bit, we have a text system that uses this node system -- this is actually where I came up with the idea. In the function linked above, `textToNodes`, it takes an input string and returns a list of nodes. But there's also some extra features inside of it.

In it, there's hardcoded handling for the `bind` modifier, which can either return normal text, or work as a modifier, depending on whether you're using controller or not.

## Typewriter Text

So now we have a simple way to parse modifiers ONCE, and display them in a very fast way, potentially every frame.

What if we want our text to be written out slowly, like our Undertale example at the start of the post?

### Dynamic Nodes

Despite having a scary name, this is a rather easy system.

Once more, you parse all of the nodes at the START. The moment your text system gets a string, parse it immediately and create a list of nodes.

Now that you have your list of nodes, this is where we do something different -- we don't draw all of the nodes, we use a *different* list of nodes, the ones we SHOULD draw.

So, let's keep a list of nodes to draw.

### The Update Function

If we want a character to be drawn every frame, let's do something like this:

```lua
---@param text string
function self:setText(text)
    self.nodes = self:processNodes(text)
    self.nodes_to_draw = {}

    self.progress = 0
    self.delay = 0
end

function self:update()
end
```

## Conclusion

This is very unfinished. I ran out of energy. I want to work on other things now thank you :D

Come back later for more probably!
